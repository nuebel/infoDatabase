Student Information Database
Created by: Nic Uebel (github.com/nuebel)

This project was created to hold and organize contact and attendance information about students involved in a campus student organization. It was developed to replace a set of MS Access databases stored on a desktop computer. 

Here are the requirements of the project:
- Store contact information for individual students, including name, email, phone, local/dorm address, home address, class, major, etc.
- Ability to create, edit, and delete student records
- Include functionality for tracking students in family groups. These are small groups that meet weekly and are named by color. This includes tracking attendance for each small group meeting.
- Be able to sort information by name, class, family group, and local address
- Search for students by any field
- Create PDFs (for printing) of any subset of students
- Create PDF mailing labels for printing out mass mailings to parents of students
- Create a list of all students that can be used to update the organization's email LISTSERV
- Maintain separate databases for each school year. Be able to switch between databases
- Use a user/pw login to prevent student contact information from being publicly available
